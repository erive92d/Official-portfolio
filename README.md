OFFICIAL PORTFOLIO


                             Hi, I'm Deorren Erive


            A UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp student hoping to land my dream job as a web developer. 

            I am 30 years old married for 3 years to my beautiful wife Susan. We have a 1 year old baby boy named Joshua a dog named Toby and a cat named Ruerue.

            I've worked in automotive industry for 5 years as a mechanic, quality control, and inspections. 

            January 2022 is when I realized that I needed a career change. After weeks of searching, I'd came across coding.

            I did have some coding experience back in 2013 when I took HTML, CSS & a little bit of Javascript in my local community college. I've always been a tech savvy and I knew that Coding is what I wanted to do.

            Joining UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp was a big step for me, my family always keep me motivated to learn new things everyday. Currently I am learning Javascript which I love because it is very challenging and I love to take on challenges!.
